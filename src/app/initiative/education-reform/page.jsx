              In a world that is rapidly evolving, the majority of schools in
              Nepal—particularly in rural areas—continue to rely on rigid,
              traditional methods of education. These systems prioritize rote
              memorization and exam results as the primary markers of success,
              often at the expense of students' holistic development and
              creativity. This narrow focus on exam performance through outdated
              teaching methods not only stifles children's potential but also
              jeopardizes their ability to build successful futures.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              At IRD, the Education Reform Initiative bridges this gap by
              empowering schools to reimagine their curriculum, pedagogy, and
              teaching practices. We collaborate with schools to foster a
              dynamic and supportive learning environment that nurtures
              creativity and promotes students' intellectual, social, emotional,
              and academic growth. By prioritizing a more holistic and
              student-centered education system, we can cultivate future leaders
              who are not only equipped to seize emerging opportunities but also
              capable of addressing the critical challenges of our time.
